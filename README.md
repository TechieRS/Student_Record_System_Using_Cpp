# Student Management System in C++

This is a simple **Student Management System** written in C++. It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like **classes**, **objects**, **encapsulation**, and **basic array manipulation**.

## 📚 Features

- Add students with name, ID, and grade
- Display all enrolled students
- Update a student's grade by ID
- Remove a student by ID
- Generate a course report showing the class average

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors and Member Functions  
- Arrays of Objects  
- Encapsulation (private/protected/public access modifiers)  
- Basic I/O operations  

## 🛠️ How It Works

- A `Student` class stores individual student details.
- A `Course` class manages an array of students with features like add, remove, update, and report generation.
- `main()` demonstrates how to use these classes by creating a course and performing various operations.

## 🧾 Sample Output

```
Course: C++ Programming  
ID: 101, Name: Ravi, Grade: 85.5  
ID: 102, Name: Bob, Grade: 90  
ID: 103, Name: Jhon, Grade: 78.5  
Class Average: 84.67  
Grade updated.  
Student removed.  
Course: C++ Programming  
ID: 102, Name: Bob, Grade: 95  
ID: 103, Name: Jhon, Grade: 78.5  
Class Average: 86.75  
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:
